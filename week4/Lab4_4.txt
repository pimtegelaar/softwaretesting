* Page 159/160 - I don't understand how to interpret the diagrams, it does not contain any information about this?
* Page 164 - The concept of 'soundness' and 'completeness' are not entirely clear. I don't understand the definition: relation 'provable' is a proper subset of 'entails' and the other way around.
* Page 168 - I don't understand how the subsequent sets of A (A2, A3, A4) can be determined?
* Page 169 - Proposition 5.42 - How does this proof show that R+ is the smallest transitive relation? I understand that it shows transitivity, but why 'smallest'?
* Page 169 - Is the 'least' transitive relation something else as the 'smallest' transitive relation?
* Page 183 - Example 5.63 - When can you use the word 'trivially' in a proof/attempt to show something? Often I see this word in the book
                            but I don't understand why it is 'trivial'. Is that an assumption about that is is 'easy' to determine?
* Page 186 - Definition 5.77 - I occasionaly see the notation '|a|'. How is this different from just 'a'?
